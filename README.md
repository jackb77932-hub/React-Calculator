# React-Calculator
A modular four-function calculator built with React. Implements state management via hooks and passes logic through props for a clean, interactive UI.

This project was built as part of the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React - Online Certification course (https://www.udemy.com/course/html-css-javascript-react-online-certification-course/) on Udemy.

**Note:** While the design and core functionality follow the tutorial, the code in this repository was written by me personally as an exercise in learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React. It is not a copy-paste of the instructor's solution.
